## Introduction  

> Raj Kapoor: I don't like to talk about my work except to those who understand what I am trying to do. In twenty years of film-making I have made ten films which, taken as a whole, embody more than just an inkling of the philosophy of Raj Kapoor. All that work led surely and inevitably to the making of Mera Naam Joker, which is a saga of life as seen through the eyes of the entertainers. It is a saga of life as it is lived in the spotlight, as we film people live it. And on the reverse side, it is also a saga of life as it is beyond the spotlight - again, as we film people experience it. It is a spiritual odyssey of the Soul of Man; of his aspirations and his essential loveliness; of his joys and sorrows; of his loves and frustrations; of the smile painted with grease paint on his face and the painful grimace concealed within it (Nanda 75)...

## Prologue: THE MASK AND THE MAN  

> A HUGE DRUM, with the laughing face of a clown painted on it, was being beaten to the rhythm of a circus band. The blue dunce’s cap with little golden bells dangling from the top of it, the cheeks red like a pair of ripe tomatoes, all the teeth on display in a wide, wild grin—but there was sadness, too, in the baby-blue eye (Abbas 7).

## Part One: TO MADAM, WITH LOVE 

> THE SOFT music was impregnated with an unmusical sound, a peculiar grating, whirring sound, as if made by the fluttering wings of the Bird of Time. As the veil of the past lifted, Rajoo found himselt looking down at a snow-covered skating rink which seemed a tank filled with milky-white water in which
many little fishes were gliding. (Abbas 22).

## Part Two: THE FAIRY AND THE FOOL ON A FLYING TRAPEZE 

> RAJOO DRIFTED FROM place to place, along with his mother, two gypsies ever on the move. The boy grew into a young man, the young man into a man. The struggle for life, the privations and the deprivations that he endured had lined his face with deeply etched creases (Abbas 80).

## Part Three: FEVER OF SUCESS  

> NOW he walked alone. He had no father, no mother, no friends, no neighbours. But the world was his home, and his heart was open to all strangers. Every man was his friend, his comrade, his neighbour (Abbas 155).

## Epilogue: POSTIVIELY NOT THE END! 

> AS THE WAVE of music swept up, the great show, starring the old joker, Rajoo, was still going on in the circus. The fragile glass heart still lay splintered on the ground, and Rajoo—the old joker—was carefully, lovingly, collecting the fragments and loading them in a hand-cart, which he then painstakingly pushed out of the ring (Abbas 220).
